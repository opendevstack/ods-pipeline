= Creating an ODS Task

Creating a technology-specific ODS Task consists of a few steps like creating a Dockerfile, OpenShift resources, the Tekton Task itself and more.

== Checklist

To create a technology-specific Task (e.g. python), the following files should be **added**:

- [ ] build/package/Dockerfile.python-toolset - The Dockerfile with the dependencies and runtime.
- [ ] build/package/scripts/build-python.sh - Bash script to carry out the build, linting, testing operations. 
- [ ] deploy/central/images/bc-ods-build-python.yml - BuildConfig to generate the ods-build-python image.
- [ ] deploy/central/images/is-ods-build-python.yml - Create ImageStream resource in OpenShift.
- [ ] deploy/central/images/kustomization.yaml - Add `bc-ods-build-python.yaml` and `is-ods-build-python.yaml` to the resources.
- [ ] deploy/central/tasks/kustomization.yaml - Add `task-ods-build-python.yaml` to the resources.
- [ ] deploy/central/tasks/task-ods-build-python.yml - The Tekton Task.
- [ ] docs/tasks/task-ods-build-python.adoc - To describe the task and its parameters.
- [ ] test/tasks/ods-build-python_test.go - A test file to test the behavior of the Tekton Task.
- [ ] test/testdata/workspaces/python-flask-sample-app - Sample application that will be used to test the Task.

The following files should be **updated**:

- [ ] .github/workflows/main.yml - Build ods python image and push it to the internal registry.
