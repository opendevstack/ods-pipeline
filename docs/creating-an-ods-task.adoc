= Creating an ODS Task

Creating a technology-specific ODS Task consists of a few steps like creating a Dockerfile, OpenShift resources, the Tekton Task itself and more.

Please see link:authoring-tasks.adoc[Authoring tasks] for documentation about the general approach of creating a task. The following goes into details which further actions need to be taken to create a task which is part of the official ODS task library.

== Checklist

To create a technology-specific Task (e.g. python), the following files should be **added**:

- [ ] build/package/Dockerfile.python-toolset - The Dockerfile with the dependencies and runtime.
- [ ] build/package/scripts/build-python.sh - Bash script to carry out the build, linting, testing operations.
- [ ] deploy/central/images/images-chart/templates/bc-ods-build-python.yaml - BuildConfig to generate the ods-build-python image.
- [ ] deploy/central/images/images-chart/templates/is-ods-build-python.yaml - Create ImageStream resource in OpenShift.
- [ ] deploy/central/tasks-charts/templates/task-ods-build-python.yaml - The Tekton Task.
- [ ] docs/tasks/task-ods-build-python.adoc - To describe the task and its parameters.
- [ ] test/tasks/ods-build-python_test.go - A test file to test the behavior of the Tekton Task.
- [ ] test/testdata/workspaces/python-fastapi-sample-app - Sample application that will be used to test the Task.

The following files should be **updated**:

- [ ] .github/workflows/main.yaml - Build ods python image and push it to the internal registry.
- [ ] Makefile - Function 'start-ods-central-builds' start builds for each ODS BuildConfig (only Openshift!)
