-	statically analyse Go source code files
-	run the Go test tool
-	build executable Go binaries


| SHR-2
| ODS Pipeline shall provide a task supporting to build JDK-based applications (such as Java, Kotlin) using Gradle:

- statically analyse Java source code files
-	run the Gradle build task (running tests and producing executable JAR files)


| SHR-3
| ODS Pipeline shall provide a task supporting to build Python applications:

- lint Python source code files
-	statically analyse Python source code files
-	run pytest


| SHR-4
| ODS Pipeline shall provide a task supporting to build Node.JS applications using npm:

-	lint JavaScript/TypeScript source code files
-	statically analyse JavaScript/TypeScript source code files
-	run the npm test script

| SHR-5
| ODS Pipeline shall provide functionality to build container images, create an SBOM file describing the contents of those images, and to scan those images for known vulnerabilities.

| SHR-6
| ODS Pipeline shall provide a task deploying Helm charts. The release namespace may be in the same cluster or an external cluster.

| SHR-10
| ODS Pipeline shall provide easy access to artifacts stored in an artifact repository of each application revision.

| SHR-11
| ODS Pipeline shall support applications with multiple components each stored in their own Git repository.

| SHR-12
| ODS Pipeline shall support applications with multiple components stored together in a single Git monorepo.

| SHR-13
| ODS pipeline shall function in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.

| SHR-14
| ODS Pipeline shall function in a corporate context (supporting HTTP proxies, private certificates and installation without external API access) when installed in an OpenShift cluster.
