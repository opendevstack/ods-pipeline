=== Software System Overview

ODS Pipeline is used alongside an existing ODS Core installation. It is a replacement for Jenkins as the CI/CD engine. The following diagram illustrates the relationship of ODS Pipeline to external systems:

The following diagram illustrates in more detail how the various components interact:

As the diagram above shows, the ODS Pipeline installation is made up of one container installed by project admins (once per project) containing configuration (config maps and secrets), the pipeline manager and task resources (Tekton task definitions and their referenced images). The following diagram shows more detail about the installation:

=== Hosting Environment

ODS Pipeline runs on Redhat OpenShift Container Platform, and is embedded into an installation of OpenDevStack.

== Deployment

There is one major deployment (typically in the project's cd-namespace) of the system managed by project administrators.

The installation provides the tasks that projects can consume as `Task` resources. It allows triggering pipelines in response to Bitbucket events.

The deployment is described in a Helm chart. For details, see the link:../installation.adoc[Installation Guide].
