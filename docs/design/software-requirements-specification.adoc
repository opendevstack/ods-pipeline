=== Software Description

ODS Pipeline shall provide CI/CD tooling within a Kubernetes cluster such as OpenShift. It shall interface with an ODS core installation (specifically, the Atlassian suite, Nexus, SonarQube and Aqua). ODS Pipeline shall provide a library of tasks which work on one or more Git repositories and:

* test applications,
* build applications,
* package applications and
* deploy applications.

The tasks shall create artifacts of their work. Those artifacts shall be stored in Nexus and are intended to be used as evidence in technical documentation.

=== General Requirements

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| SRS-GENERAL-1
| ODS Pipeline shall be installable in Kubernetes (1.21+) clusters with Tekton (0.24+) installed.

| SRS-GENERAL-2
| ODS Pipeline shall be installable in OpenShift (4.8+) clusters with the OpenShift Pipelines (1.5+) operator installed.

| SRS-GENERAL-3
| ODS Pipeline shall be installable without cluster admin permissions.

| SRS-GENERAL-4
| ODS Pipeline shall function within corporate networks (HTTP proxy, private CA).
|===

=== Pipeline Manager Requirements

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| SRS-PIPELINE-MANAGER-1
| The pipeline manager shall be able to respond to `repo:refs_changed` and `pr:opened` events.

| SRS-PIPELINE-MANAGER-2
| The pipeline manager shall not trigger pipelines for Git commits which message instructs to skip CI.

| SRS-PIPELINE-MANAGER-3
| The pipeline manager shall create or update a pipeline corresponding to the Git branch received in the webhook request. The tasks (including finally tasks) of the pipline shall be read from the ODS config file in the repository.

| SRS-PIPELINE-MANAGER-4
| The pipeline manager shall create a PVC for use as a pipeline workspace per repository.

| SRS-PIPELINE-MANAGER-5
| The pipeline manager shall prune pipelines and pipeline runs per repository and stage.

| SRS-PIPELINE-MANAGER-6
| The pipeline manager shall prevent concurrent pipeline runs for one repository.
|===

=== Tasks Requirements

==== Task `ods-start`

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| SRS-TASK-START-1
