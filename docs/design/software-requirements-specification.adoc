=== Software Description

ODS Pipeline shall provide CI/CD tooling within a Kubernetes cluster such as OpenShift. It shall interface with an ODS core installation (specifically, the Atlassian suite, Nexus, SonarQube and Aqua). ODS Pipeline shall provide a library of tasks which work on one or more Git repositories and:

* test applications,
* build applications,
* package applications and
* deploy applications.

The tasks shall create artifacts of their work. Those artifacts shall be stored in Nexus and are intended to be used as evidence in technical documentation.

| SRS-GENERAL-3
| ODS Pipeline shall be installable without cluster admin permissions.

| SRS-GENERAL-4
| ODS Pipeline shall function within corporate networks (HTTP proxy, private CA).

| SRS-GENERAL-5
| ODS Pipeline shall automatically build container images after installation / update.

| SRS-GENERAL-6
| ODS Pipeline shall support installation from within an OpenShift Web Terminal when the OpenShift API cannot be accessed from outside the cluster.
