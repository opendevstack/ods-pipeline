= `ODS.YAML` Reference

This guide will explain how to configure pipelines for your repositories in an `ods.yaml` file. The configuration in `ods.yaml` allows five top-level fields:

* `pipeline`
* `environments`
* `branchToEnvironmentMapping`
* `version`
* `repositories`

== `pipeline`

The pipeline field allows to define the pipeline tasks. Normal tasks may be specified under `tasks`. Example:

.ods.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  tasks:
  - name: backend-build-go
    taskRef:
      kind: Task
      name: ods-build-go-v0-5-1
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
----

Each task reference is just the plain Tekton definition. See the Tekton documentation on link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#adding-tasks-to-the-pipeline[Adding Tasks to the Pipeline] for more information.

A typical `ods-pipeline` installation offers its task as `Task` resources, therefore the `taskRef.kind` needs to be `Task`. The value of the `taskRef.name` field depends on the version of `ods-pipeline` that is installed in your project. Available tasks for you to use can be found in your OpenShift console UI under "Pipelines > Tasks".

The pipeline created based on the configuration will have a workspace named `shared-workspace` available, which is backed by a PVC (named `ods-pipeline`) in your namespace.

Next to the tasks you specify, `ods-pipeline` will automatically inject two tasks into the pipeline, `ods-start` and `ods-finish`. `ods-start` is inserted as the very first task, checking out the repository given in the webhook, setting the Bitbucket build status and dealing with Nexus artifacts, etc.

The `ods-finish` task is added as a final task to the pipeline. Final tasks run at the end, regardless whether all previous tasks succeeded. The `ods-finish` sets the Bitbucket build status and deals with Nexus artifacts, etc.

You can also specify further final tasks to be added to the pipeline by specifying them under `finally`. Example:

.ods.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  tasks: [ ... ]
  finally:
  - name: foo
    taskRef:
      kind: Task
      name: foo
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
----

Note that you cannot configure the execution order of final tasks. Final tasks all run simultaneously. For more information on final tasks, see the Tekton documentation on link:https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#adding-finally-to-the-pipeline[Adding Finally to the Pipeline].

== `environments`

The `environments` field allows you to specify target environments to deploy to. Each environment must have a `name` and a `stage` field. Example:

.ods.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
environments:
- name: development
  stage: dev
----

The value of `name` may freely be chosen, but must only contain lowercase `a-z` and dashes (`-`). The `stage` must be one of `dev`, `qa` or `prod`. Each environment corresponds to one namespace in an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster. The namespace may either be specified explicitly (via `namespace`), or it will be computed based on the project and the environment name (`<PROJECT>-<ENV-NAME>`). In the example above, `namespace` is not configured, therefore the target namespace will be resolved to `foo-development` (if the project is named `foo`).

Environments may also be located external to the cluster in which the pipeline runs. In this case, an environment may specify further fields:

* `apiServer`: API server of the target cluster, including scheme
* `apiCredentialsSecret`: Name of the Secret resource holding the API user credentials in field `token`
* `registryHost`: Hostname of the target registry
* `config`: Additional configuration of the target in the form of a map. This information may be used by custom tasks.

== `branchToEnvironmentMapping`

In order for the pipeline to select an environment to deploy to, you have to configure which branch should be deployed to which environment. This can be done via `branchToEnvironmentMapping`. Example:

.ods.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
branchToEnvironmentMapping:
- branch: master
  environment: development
----

In this case, the `master` branch will be deployed to the environment with the name `development`.

The `branch` field also supports wildcard suffix match: use `&#42;` to match any branch, or e.g. `release/*` to match all branches that are prefixed with `release/`.

TIP: If you want to promote images between environments without rebuilding them, ensure that you are merging without merge commits (fast-forward, `--ff-only`).

== `version`

`version` is an optional field that can specify a link:https://semver.org[SemVer] version. Its value will be available in the pipeline context. The link:tasks/ods-start.adoc[`ods-start` task] requires a value to be present when the target environment is of stage `qa` or `prod`. When this is the case, the task applies Git tags (`v<VERSION>-rc.<NUMBER>` for `qa` and `v<VERSION>` for `prod`) to the repository and ensures that a pipeline run for a `qa` environment exist before allowing to proceed to a `prod` environment.

== `repositories`

If your application is made out of multiple components, you may want to have one "umbrella" repository that ties all those components together and deploys the whole application together. In this case, the umbrella repository can specify the subrepositories via the `repositories` field. Example:

.ods.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
repositories:
- name: foo
- name: bar
  branch: main
  url: https://bitbucket.acme.org/scm/baz/bar.git
----

If the repository does not specify a URL, the repository is assumed to be under the same organisation as the repository hosting the `ods.yaml` file. If no branch is given, `master` is used as a default.

Repositories listed in `ods.yaml` are checked out in `ods-start` in `.ods/repos` and any tasks in the pipeline can alter their behaviour based on the presence of subrepos. For example, the `ods-deploy-helm` task will package any charts in subrepos and add them to the chart in the umbrella repository, deploying all charts as one release.
