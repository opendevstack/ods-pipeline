= ods-build-gradle

Builds Gradle applications.

The gradle build by default caches the downloaded version of the gradle wrapper and dependencies in the cache location of
the PVC by setting the environment variable `GRADLE_USER_HOME` to `/workspace/source/.ods-cache/deps/gradle`. 

The following steps are executed:

- build gradle application, using `gradlew clean build`, which includes tests execution and coverage report generation
- SonarQube quality scan

Notes:

- tests exclude the vendor directory.
- test results are converted into xUnit format.

Available environment variables:

- `ODS_OUTPUT_DIR`: this environment variable points to the folder
that this build expects generated application artifacts to be copied to.
The gradle script should read it and copy there the generated artifacts.
- `NEXUS_*` env vars: `NEXUS_URL`, `NEXUS_USERNAME` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD`
are available and should be read by the gradle script.

To enable the gradle script to copy the generated application artifacts script follow these steps:

- read the environment variable `ODS_OUTPUT_DIR` in the buildscript section of the gradle script:
```
buildscript {
    ext {
      outputDir = System.getenv('ODS_OUTPUT_DIR')
    }
}
```
- customize the jar tasks to set the destination directory
```
jar {
    println("Set application jar name to 'app'")
    archiveBaseName = 'app'
    if (outputDir != null) {
        println("Set destinationDirectory to '${projectDir}/${outputDir}'")
        destinationDirectory = file("${projectDir}/${outputDir}")
    }
}
```

To create a coverage report be sure that you add to `gradle.properties` the required
configuration. For example to enable Jacoco coverage repot you will need to:

- add `jacoco` plugin:
```
plugins {
    id 'application'
    id 'jacoco'
}
```
- add task `jacocoTestReport`:
```
jacocoTestReport {
    reports {
        xml.required = true
    }
}
```
- add `finalizedBy jacocoTestReport` to the task `test`:
```
tasks.named('test') {
    useJUnitPlatform()
    finalizedBy jacocoTestReport
}
```

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-gradle.sh[build/package/scripts/build-gradle.sh].

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.xml`
* `sonarqube-analysis/`
  ** `analysis-report.md`
  ** `issues-report.csv`
  ** `quality-gate.json`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| gradle-additional-tasks
| 
| Additional gradle tasks to be passed to the gradle build. (default tasks called are `clean` and `build`).


| gradle-options
| --no-daemon --stacktrace
| Options to be passed to the gradle build. (See ref: https://docs.gradle.org/7.4.2/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_debugging)


| gradle-opts-env
| -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx512M
| Will be exposed to the build via `GRADLE_OPTS` environment variable. Specifies JVM arguments to use when starting the Gradle client VM. The client VM only handles command line input/output, so it is rare that one would need to change its VM options. You can still use this to change the settings for the Gradle daemon which runs the actual build by setting the according Gradle properties by `-D`. If you want to set the JVM arguments for the actual build you would do this via `-Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1024M` (See ref: https://docs.gradle.org/7.4.2/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties).


| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which the resulting Java application jar should be copied, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| sonar-quality-gate
| false
| Whether the SonarQube quality gate needs to pass for the task to succeed.


| sonar-skip
| false
| Whether to skip SonarQube analysis or not.
