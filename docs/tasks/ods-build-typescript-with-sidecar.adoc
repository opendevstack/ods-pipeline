= ods-build-typescript-with-sidecar

Builds Typescript applications.

The following steps are executed:

- linting using `eslint`
- build typescript application, using `npm run build`
- test execution
- SonarQube quality scan

All reports (xUnit report, coverage report and linting report) are placed into `.ods/artifacts`.

For `eslint` to work there needs to be a config file (`eslintrc.json` or similar) at the root of the working directory.
This can be done by running `eslint --init` or by following the link:https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started[official documentation]

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-typescript.sh[build/package/scripts/build-typescript.sh].
In particular, `npm run build` is expected to place outputs into `dist`.

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

**Sidecar variant!** Use this task if you need to run a container next to the build task.
For example, this could be used to run a database to allow for integration tests.
The sidecar image to must be supplied via `sidecar-image`.
Apart from the sidecar, the task is an exact copy of `ods-build-typescript`.
