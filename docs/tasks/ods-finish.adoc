= ods-finish

Finishes the pipeline run.

This task sets the build status of
the built commit in Bitbucket according to the aggregate task status.

If an artifact target is given, any created artifacts will be uploaded to that Nexus repository, associated with the checked out Git commit.

If configured, the task sends notifications to a defined webhook receiver. The HTTP method,
payload content type, webhook URL, status values that trigger a notification, and a template
for the payload to be sent can be configured via the `ods-notification` ConfigMap. An example
configuration for Microsoft Teams (excluding the webhook URL) is included in the ods-pipeline
standard installation.

*This task is automatically added to any pipeline run as the last task
by the pipeline manager. To customize parameters, configure them in the relevant trigger and prefix each param with `finish.`*

The following artifacts are generated by the task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `pipeline-runs/`
  ** `<pipeline-run-name>.json`
