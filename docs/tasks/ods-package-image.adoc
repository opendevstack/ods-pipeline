= ods-package-image

Packages applications into container images using
link:https://buildah.io[buildah].

buildah builds a container image from the `docker-dir` directory using the
provided `dockerfile`.
The following `--build-arg` parameters are provided to enable convenient access
to Nexus:

* nexusUrl=${NEXUS_URL}
* nexusUsername=Escaped(${NEXUS_USERNAME})
* nexusPassword=Escaped(${NEXUS_PASSWORD})
* nexusHost=Host(${NEXUS_URL})
* nexusAuth=${nexusUsername}:$(nexusPassword)
* nexusUrlWithAuth=${nexusUrl.withAuth($nexusAuth)}

The above is adhoc notation meant to be more clear than a bunch of words.
If no nexusUsername/nexusPassword are defined nexusAuth will be empty and
nexusUrlWithAuth is equal to nexusUrl.

By default, the image is named after the component and pushed into the image
stream located in the namespace of the pipeline run.

If link:https://www.aquasec.com/products/container-security/[Aqua security scanning]
is enabled in the cluster, images are scanned and registered in Aqua after
they are pushed to the image stream. JSON and HTML report artifacts are
generated. Further, if there is an open pull request on Bitbucket for the
built branch, a code insight report is attached to the Git commit.

The following artifacts are generated by the task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `aquasec-scans/`
  ** `report.html`
  ** `report.json`
* `image-digests/`
  ** `<image-name>.json`
