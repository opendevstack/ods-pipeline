Builds Python applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-python.sh[build/package/scripts/build-python.sh].
In particular, the Python source files are expected to be located in `src`.

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.xml`
* `sonarqube-analysis/`
  ** `analysis-report.md`
  ** `issues-report.csv`
  ** `quality-gate.json`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`

Instead of the built-in script, one can also specify a build script located
in the Git repository using the `build-script` task parameter. This allows
full control of building and testing, including any generation of artifacts.
Note that some other task parameters have no effect when a custom build
script is used, unless they are handled properly in the script. At a
minimum, the custom script should place its outputs in the directory
identified by `output-dir`.
