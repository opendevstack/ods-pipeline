Finishes the pipeline run.

This task uploads generated artifacts to Nexus, and sets the build status of
the built commit in Bitbucket according to the aggregate task status.

If configured, the task sends notifications to a defined webhook receiver. The HTTP method,
payload content type, webhook URL, status values that trigger a notification, and a template
for the payload to be sent can be configured via the `ods-notification` ConfigMap. An example
configuration for Microsoft Teams (excluding the webhook URL) is included in the ods-pipeline
standard installation.

This task is automatically added to any pipeline run in as a `finally` task
by the pipeline manager and cannot be customized by users at this point.

The following artifacts are generated by the task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `pipeline-runs/`
  ** `<pipeline-run-name>.json`
