Starts the pipeline run.

This task will clone a repo from the provided url into the workspace, and
sets the build status of the checked out commit in Bitbucket to "in progress".

If the checked out repositories' `ods.y(a)ml` file defines subrepos, those will
be checked out as well into `.ods/repos`. Subrepos will be checked out at
the branch specified in `ods.y(a)ml` or `master` if no branch is given.
However, if a version (e.g. `1.0.0`) is defined in `ods.y(a)ml`, then
subrepos are checked out at a corresponding release branch (e.g.
`release/1.0.0`) if it exists.

If an artifact source is given, any artifacts in that Nexus repository for the checked out Git commits are downloaded and
placed into `.ods/artifacts`. When subrepos are configured, a successful
pipeline run must exist for each subrepo for the pipeline to continue. If no
such run artifact exists, the pipeline will stop. Users will need to re-run
the pipeline of the subrepo first before running the pipeline of the
umbrella repo again.

*This task is automatically added to any pipeline run as the first task
by the pipeline manager. To customize parameters, configure them in the relevant trigger and prefix each param with `start.`*
