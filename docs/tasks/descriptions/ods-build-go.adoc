Builds Go (module) applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-go.sh[build/package/scripts/build-go.sh].

The following provides an overview of the performed steps:

- Source files are checked to be formatted with `gofmt`.
- The go module cache is configured to be on the cache location of the PVC by setting environment variable `GOMODCACHE` to `.ods-cache/deps/gomod` (see link:https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-cache[go module cache]).
- `golanci-lint` is run. The linter can be configured via a
  config file as described in the
  link:https://golangci-lint.run/usage/configuration/[configuration documentation].
- Tests are executed. A potential `vendor` directory is excluded. Test
  results are converted into xUnit format.
- Application binary (named `app`) is built and placed into the directory
  specified by `output-dir`.

Finally, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.out`
* `lint-reports/`
  ** `report.txt`
* `sonarqube-analysis/`
  ** `analysis-report.md`
  ** `issues-report.csv`
  ** `quality-gate.json`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`

Instead of the built-in script, one can also specify a build script located
in the Git repository using the `build-script` task parameter. This allows
full control of building and testing, including any generation of artifacts.
Note that some other task parameters have no effect when a custom build
script is used, unless they are handled properly in the script. At a
minimum, the custom script should place its outputs in the directory
identified by `output-dir`.
