Deploy Helm charts.

This tasks will install / upgrade a Helm chart into your Kubernetes /
OpenShift cluster using Helm.

Helm has the plugins `helm-diff` and `helm-secrets` installed. A diff is
performed before an upgrade is attempted. `helm-secrets` can be used to
encrypt sensitive values in the underlying Git repository using
https://age-encryption.org[age]. Secrets are decrypted on the fly if the
secret identified by the `age-key-secret` parameter exists and contains an
age secret key which corresponding public key was used as one of the
recipients to encrypt.

Based on the target environment, some values files are added automatically
to the invocation of the `helm` command if they are present in the chart
directory:

- `values.yaml`: the values file (automatically considered by Helm).
- `secrets.yaml`: a secrets file.
- `values.<NAMESPACE>.yaml`: a values file named after the target namespace.
- `secrets.<NAMESPACE>.yaml`: a secrets file named after the target namespace.

Further, the task automatically sets the `image.tag` value on the CLI which
equals the Git commit SHA being built. This value can be used in your Helm
templates to refer to images built via `ods-package-image`.

Before the Helm chart is applied, it is packaged, setting the `appVersion`
to the Git commit SHA and the `version` to the externally provided version,
if any. If `version` is not given, the value in `Chart.yaml` is used as-is.

If the pipeline runs for a repository defining subrepos in its `ods.y(a)ml`
file, then any charts in those subrepos are packaged as well, and added as
dependencies to the top-most chart under `charts/`. Note that values and
secrets files are only collected from the repository for which the pipeline
runs. Therefore, if you use an umbrella repository to promote an
application consisting of multiple repositories, the umbrella repository
needs to define the environment specific values for the subcomponents
for instead of having those files in the subrepo.

In order to produce correct `image.tag` values for subcomponents, the task
automatically sets `<subcomponent>.image.tag` equal to the Git commit SHA of
the subcomponent. Further, if no release name is explicitly configured, the
task also sets `<subcomponent>.fullnameOverride` equal to the respective
subcomponent to avoid resources being prefixed with the umbrella repository
component name (assuming your resources are named using the `chart.fullname`
helper).

If you do not have an existing Helm chart yet, you can use the provided
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/tree/sample-helm-chart[sample chart]
as a starting point. It is setup in a way that works with this task out of
the box.

The following artifacts are generated by the task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `deployments/`
  ** `diff-<namespace>.txt`
  ** `release-<namespace>.txt`
