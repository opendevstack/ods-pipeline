= ods-build-python

Builds Python applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-python.sh[build/package/scripts/build-python.sh].
In particular, the Python source files are expected to be located in `src`.

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.xml`
* `sonarqube-analysis/`
  ** `analysis-report.md`
  ** `issues-report.csv`
  ** `quality-gate.json`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which outputs should be placed, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| cache-build
| false
| If enabled tasks uses or populates cache with the output dir contents (and artifacts) so that a build can be skipped if the `working-dir` contents did not change. For single build repos enabling build caching has limited benefits. For multi build repos enabling this is recommended unless the build is dependant on files outside of the working directory. See ADR caching-build-tasks for more details and workarounds.


| max-line-length
| 120
| Maximum line length.


| pre-test-script
| 
| Script to execute before running tests, relative to the working directory.


| build-script
| /usr/local/bin/build-python
| Build script to execute. The link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-python.sh[default script] is located in the container image. If you specify a relative path instead, it will be resolved from the workspace. See the task definition for details how the build script is invoked.


| sonar-quality-gate
| false
| Whether quality gate needs to pass.


| sonar-skip
| false
| Whether to skip the SonarQube analysis or not.

== Results

[cols="1,3"]

| Name | Description

| build-reused-from-location
| The cache location that the build task used. If caching is not enabled this will be an empty string.
