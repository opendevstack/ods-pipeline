= ods-build-python

Builds Python applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-python.sh[build/package/scripts/build-python.sh].
In particular, the Python source files are expected to be located in `src`.

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

The following artifacts are generated by the build task and placed into `.ods/artifacts/`

* `code-coverage/`
  ** `coverage.xml`
* `sonarqube-analysis/`
  ** `analysis-report.md`
  ** `issues-report.csv`
  ** `quality-gate.json`
* `xunit-reports/`
  ** `report.xml`

Instead of the built-in script, one can also specify a build script located
in the Git repository using the `build-script` task parameter. This allows
full control of building and testing, including any generation of artifacts.
Note that some other task parameters have no effect when a custom build
script is used, unless they are handled properly in the script. At a
minimum, the custom script should place its outputs in the directory
identified by `output-dir`.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| cache-build
| true
| If enabled tasks uses or populates cache with the output dir contents (and artifacts) so that a build can be skipped if the `working-dir` contents did not change. You must set this to `"false"` if the build can be affected by files outside `working-dir`. See ADR caching-build-tasks for more details and workarounds.


| build-extra-inputs
| 
| List of build source directories (as colon separated string) which in addition working-dir influence the build. These directories are relative to the repository root. If the contents in these directories change the cache is invalidated so that the build task will rebuild from scratch.


| max-line-length
| 120
| Maximum line length.


| pre-test-script
| 
| Script to execute before running tests, relative to the working directory.


| build-script
| /usr/local/bin/build-python
| Build script to execute. The link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-python.sh[default script] is located in the container image. If you specify a relative path instead, it will be resolved from the workspace. See the task definition for details how the build script is invoked.


| sonar-quality-gate
| false
| Whether quality gate needs to pass.


| sonar-skip
| false
| Whether to skip the SonarQube analysis or not.

== Results

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name | Description

| build-reused-from-location
| The cache location that the build task used. If caching is not enabled this will be an empty string.
