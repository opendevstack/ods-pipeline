= ods-build-python

Builds Python applications.

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-python.sh[build/package/scripts/build-python.sh].
In particular, the Python source files are expected to be located in `src`.

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.
