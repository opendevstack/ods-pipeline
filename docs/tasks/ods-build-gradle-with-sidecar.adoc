= ods-build-gradle-with-sidecar

Builds Gradle applications.

The following steps are executed:

- build gradle application, using `gradlew clean build`, which includes tests execution and coverage report generation
- SonarQube quality scan

Notes:

- tests exclude the vendor directory.
- test results are converted into xUnit format.
- both xUnit report and coverage report are placed into `.ods/artifacts`.

Available environment variables:

- `ODS_OUTPUT_DIR`: this environment variable points to the folder
that this build expects generated application artifacts to be copied to.
The gradle script should read it and copy there the generated artifacts.
- `NEXUS_*` env vars: `NEXUS_URL`, `NEXUS_USERNAME` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD`
are available and should be read by the gradle script.

To enable the gradle script to copy the generated application artifacts script follow these steps:

- read the environment variable `ODS_OUTPUT_DIR` in the buildscript section of the gradle script:
```
buildscript {
    ext {
      outputDir = System.getenv('ODS_OUTPUT_DIR')
    }
}
```
- customize the jar tasks to set the destination directory
```
jar {
    println("Set application jar name to 'app'")
    archiveBaseName = 'app'
    if (outputDir != null) {
        println("Set destinationDirectory to '${projectDir}/${outputDir}'")
        destinationDirectory = file("${projectDir}/${outputDir}")
    }
}
```

To create a coverage report be sure that you add to `gradle.properties` the required
configuration. For example to enable Jacoco coverage repot you will need to:

- add `jacoco` plugin:
```
plugins {
    id 'application'
    id 'jacoco'
}
```
- add task `jacocoTestReport`:
```
jacocoTestReport {
    reports {
      xml.enabled true
    }
}
```
- add `finalizedBy jacocoTestReport` to the task `test`:
```
tasks.named('test') {
    useJUnitPlatform()
    finalizedBy jacocoTestReport
}
```

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-gradle.sh[build/package/scripts/build-gradle.sh].

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

**Sidecar variant!** Use this task if you need to run a container next to the build task.
For example, this could be used to run a database to allow for integration tests.
The sidecar image to must be supplied via `sidecar-image`.
Apart from the sidecar, the task is an exact copy of `ods-build-gradle`.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| gradle-additional-tasks
| 
| Additional gradle tasks to be passed to the gradle build. (default tasks called are `clean` and `build`).


| gradle-options
| 
| Options to be passed to the gradle build. (See ref: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_debugging)


| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which the resulting Java application jar should be copied, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| sonar-quality-gate
| false
| Whether the SonarQube quality gate needs to pass for the task to succeed.


| sonar-skip
| false
| Whether to skip SonarQube analysis or not.


| sidecar-image
| 
| Image to use for sidecar
