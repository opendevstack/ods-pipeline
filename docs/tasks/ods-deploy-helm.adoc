= ods-deploy-helm

Deploy Helm charts.

This tasks will install / upgrade a Helm chart into your Kubernetes /
OpenShift cluster using Helm.

Helm has the plugins `helm-diff` and `helm-secrets` installed. A diff is performed
before an upgrade is attempted. `helm-secrets` can be used to encrypt sensitive
values in the underlying Git repository.

Based on the target environment, some values files are added automatically to the
invocation of the `helm` command if they are present:

- `values.<STAGE>.yaml`: a values file named after the stage (`dev`, `qa` or `prod`) of the target environment.
- `values.<ENVIRONMENT>.yaml`: a values file named after the name of the target environment.

Further, the task adds a `values.generated.yaml` file. This values file
contains only one value, `gitCommitSha`, which contains the Git commit SHA being built. It is
provided by the task as this value cannot be known by value file authors in advance. Use this
value to set e.g. the image tags in `Deployment` resources, like this: ``.

Before the Helm chart is applied, it is packaged, setting the `appVersion` to the Git commit SHA
and the `version` to the externally provided version, if any. If `version` is not given, the value
in `Chart.yaml` is used as-is.

If the pipeline runs for a repository defining subrepos in its `ods.yml` file, then any charts in
those subrepos are packaged as well, and added as dependencies to the top-most chart under `charts/`.
