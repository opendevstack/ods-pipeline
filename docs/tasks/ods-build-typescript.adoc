= ods-build-typescript

Builds Typescript applications.

The following steps are executed:

- linting using `eslint`
- build typescript application, using `npm run build`
- test execution
- SonarQube quality scan

All reports (xUnit report, coverage report and linting report) are placed into `.ods/artifacts`.

For `eslint` to work there needs to be a config file (`eslintrc.json` or similar) at the root of the working directory.
This can be done by running `eslint --init` or by following the link:https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started[official documentation]

The exact build recipe can be found at
link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline/blob/master/build/package/scripts/build-typescript.sh[build/package/scripts/build-typescript.sh].
In particular, `npm run build` is expected to place outputs into `dist`.

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.
Default SonarQube project properties are provided unless `sonar-project.properties`
is present.
When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which outputs should be placed, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| max-lint-warnings
| 0
| Maximum of allowed linting warnings after which eslint will exit with an error. Set to "-1" to never exit with an error due to warnings.


| lint-file-ext
| .js,.ts,.jsx,.tsx,.svelte
| File extensions to lint separated by a comma.


| sonar-quality-gate
| false
| Whether quality gate needs to pass.


| sonar-skip
| false
| Whether to skip the SonarQube analysis or not.


| node-version
| 16
| Node.js version to use - supported versions: 16


| build-dir
| dist
| Must match the directory into which `npm run build` places files. The files inside `build-dir` will be copied to `output-dir`.


| copy-node-modules
| false
| Whether `node-modules` is copied to the `output-dir` or not. For frontend components this should be set to "false", while for backend components this should be set to "true". Other common build directories are `build` and `public`.
