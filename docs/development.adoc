= Development & Running tests

First, check if your system meets the prerequisites:
```
make check-system
```

Then, run all tests:
```
make test
```

To see all available `make` targets:
```
make help
```

== Testing

As mentioned above, `make test` will run all tests. You may also run only a subset of tests:

* `make test-cmd` for the packages under `cmd`
* `make test-pkg` for the packages under `pkg`
* `make test-internal` for the packages under `internal`
* `make test-e2e-tasks` for the task tests
* `make test-e2e-pipelineruns` for the pipeline run tests
* `make test-e2e` for the task tests and the pipeline run tests

Images used in tasks are rebuilt automatically before executing tests. This provides the best accuracy but it can slow down testing considerably. If you did not make changes since the last test run that would affect the images, you can pass `-ods-reuse-images` to `go test`.
